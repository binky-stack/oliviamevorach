i began the design for josh's portfolio pulling together some colors and fonts i thought might work nicely side-by-side. i knew i wanted [whatever ends up being] the pictures of the play packet to face each other, my thought was that perhaps the further i get into graphic design, the more life & texture i could add to the margins.
</p>
<p>
the horizontal scroll excites me. i tried to code a horizontal layout once before and it didn't pan out well and proved exhausted when on desktop-view.
i've decided to approach this portfolio with a less uptight mindset. at first bracket, i was intimidated by what i didn't know. 
i thought i'd end up making a design too similar to this site or thelockdowncollective.
in some ways this is very similar but im hoping the similarities lie mostly in the simplicity of the layouts, rather than the structure of the pages...
i love learning new ways to position things on the grid. 
</p>
<p>
my goal for this portfolio is to work with josh to portray his art/work in a friendly & easily navigable way. <br /> i hope to bring new shapes and colors into the next
two pages that need coding!
