i began the design for josh's portfolio pulling together some colors and fonts i thought might work nicely side-by-side. i knew i wanted [whatever ends up being] the pictures of the play packet to face each other, my thought was that perhaps the further i get into graphic design, the more life & texture i could add to the margins.
</p>
<p>
the horizontal scroll excites me. i tried to code a horizontal layout once before and it didn't pan out well for me. i've decided to approach this portfolio with a less uptight mindset. at first bracket, i was intimidated by what i didn't know. 
i thought i'd end up making a design too similar to this site or thelockdowncollective.
in some ways this is very similar but im hoping the similarities lie mostly in the simplicity of the layouts. 
</p>
<p>
my goal overall is to convey josh's intended information in an easy, straightforward, slick way. the more javascript i learn, the smoother i'd like to make the site transitions and scroll behavior.
